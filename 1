<h1>"converting decimal numbers"</h1>
<p> To convert a decimal number into binary you are going to
take that number and divide it by two. The number that you get
as the residual is going to be part of the binary code, and
the number you get on top, is going to be divided by two.
You are going to keep dividing the number on top until
you get zero. For the residual, you should allways get a 1, or a
0.

<h2> "converting decimal to hexadecimal"</h2>
<p> To conver a decimal number to hexadecimal you are going to pretty much
follow almost the same steps, but you are going to divide by 16 and, if the
residual is greater than 9, the number is going to be translated into a letter.
